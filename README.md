Objectives
-----------
This assignment allows you to study design pattern, in-depth sorting algorithms
and the concepts of analyzing algorithms through empirical method
(experimentally) and at the same time able to compare the results with the
theoretical analysis (O-notation)). The empirical method is carried by an
implementation of a program that counts the number of elementary operations
performed.

Specification
--------------
Write a program in Java. The program is required to implement insertion, bubble,
quick and radix sort algorithms on a list of words in lexicographic
order. Add a counter in appropriate location of your implementation to count
the number of times elementary operations namely the number of assignments
and the number of comparisons etc are performed in the algorithm. Run the
program using experimental English dataset given and try to find and run the
worst case, average case and best case, by randomizing the order of the
dataset 20 times.

1) Implement the sorting algorithms and make sure they run as it suppose to be on the
   English dataset. (+50%)
2) Use good object oriented practice (e.g. comment, indentation, function, object â€¦)
   and appropriate design pattern when implementing the sorting algorithms.
   (+20%)
3) Demonstrate the ability of the program to handle French word list. (+5%)
4) Randomize the order and sizes of the dataset 20 times and plot the best case,
   average cast and worst case times of the 4 sort algorithms on a single graph.
   (+20%)
5) Analyze 3) and compare the results against theoretical analysis (big O). (+5%)
